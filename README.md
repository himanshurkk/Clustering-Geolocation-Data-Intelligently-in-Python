# Clustering-Geolocation-Data-Intelligently-in-Python
Visualize Geo location data interactively using clustering and K-Means algorithm in Python

# About Project
- In this project, I learned how to visualize geolocation data clearly and interactively using Python. 
- I also learned a simple but limited approach to clustering this data, using the K-Means algorithm. 
- I developed on this notion of clustering by moving to more advanced density-based methods, namely Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, known as DBSCAN, and in order to address some of its shortcomings, the more advanced Hierarchical DBSCAN (HDBSCAN). 
- I also use simple method of addressing outliers that may exist in a clustering problem.
- plot this data in an interactive way within Python that can be exported easily.
